# Gitflow

Back in 2010 Vincent Driessen presented a branching methodology named [Gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) [1]. The goal of Gitflow is provide a simple way to generate development branches and be able to merge them back to master in an orderly fashion.

I will strongly recommend that you read the original post 'A successful Git branching model' (http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) where Vincent goes over the methodology in detail.

Gitflow is important to us because it allows us to generate new feature branches without the fear of breaking our release branch. We can then test new features and only release a new version when they are stable.
