## Profiles

A **profile** is a collection of technologies, brought together for a specific purpose.

Here a are some examples:
* a Wordpress Site
* a Ruby on Rails Application
* a Node.js Application

A profile's responsibility is too coordinate multiple pieces of technology. Not by managing them itself but delegating that responsibility to their specific modules. 

Must of the time a profile will set up scaffolding for an application using that particular technology stack.
