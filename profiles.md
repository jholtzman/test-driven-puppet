## Profiles

A **profile** is a collection of technologies, brought together for a specific purpose.

Here a are some examples:
* a Wordpress Site
* a Ruby on Rails Application
* a Node.js Application

A profile's responsability is too coordinate several pieces of technology. Not by managing them itself but delegating that responsibility to their specific modules.
