## Manage Ruby with RVM

Puppet is a ruby gem. 

If you want puppet to run you will need to have ruby installed.

Using the recommended installation procedure from the Puppetlabs [1] site will give you the minimum requirements to run Puppet in your system. 

Unfortunately this means that your will probably end up with ruby version 1.8.7.
