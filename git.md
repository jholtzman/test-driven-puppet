# Git

Source control should be part of your day to day tool box. If it is not I recommend that you take the time to learn how to use it. The benefits you will rip will surpass any time you invest in it. [1]

It's relationship with Puppet is in two aspects. One, keeping track of your work and second module distribution.

I recommend that you make sure you know about the following terms and that you feel confident using them.

## Things to know

* Initializing a Repository
* Commit Changes
* Branching
* Tagging
* Pushing and Pulling from remote repositories
* Re-basing

## A simple example

Start a simple project using Ruby 2.2.1 and Puppet 4.2.1.

```bash
vagrant:$ mkdir git-project
vagrant:$ 
```
