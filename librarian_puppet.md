## Librarian Puppet

"Librarian-puppet is a bundler for your puppet infrastructure. You can use librarian-puppet to manage the puppet modules your infrastructure depends on, whether the modules come from the Puppet Forge, Git repositories or a just a path." [1]

Just like the description reads librarian-puppet is a gem that uses a manifest file (Puppetfile) to list all your module's private an public dependencies. And it uses this file to download and install
